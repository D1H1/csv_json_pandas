California Gold Rush was a period of courage, bravado and curiosity. It was with these characteristics in mind that we crafted Gold Rush Red. Grapes chosen from the golden hills and valleys of California were blended to create this bold, adventurous testament to that intrepid spirit.","2":"The California Gold Rush was a period of courage, bravado and curiosity. Gold Rush is crafted with these characteristics in mind. The grapes used to blend this bold wine are carefully selected from golden hills and valleys of California. It is finished in bourbon barrels, which complements this rich wine with notes of charred vanilla and dried herbs. ","4":"Batch #004 is the first release of the 2014 vintage and once againMendocino Zinfandel plays a big role in the blend with classic oldvineyards such as Sargentini and Rucker vineyards. Head trained and dry farmed, these vineyards give nice raspberry fruits. Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel also makes a big impact on the blend in Batch #004. Dry Creek is a classic and well known source for great Zinfandel and has added a new dimension to the 1000 Stories blend. Black fruits with distinct notes of black pepper and even a bit of clove spice add complexity to the blend. Also new to this batch is the addition of Lodi Zinfandel, with its iconic bold flavors and big character. Rounding out the blend are some Zinfandels from Colusa County, Syrah from Paso Robles and Petite sirah from Mendocino. A portion of the wine is aged in French and American oak for 6 months and then aged further in bourbon barrels. We\u2019ve selected new and used bourbon barrels for these small batches of Zinfandel, which impart characteristics specific to these barrels: charred vanilla, dried herbs and a hint of caramel.","5":"1,000 Stories Bourbon barrel-aged Zinfandel is a harmonious balance of Zinfandel grapes from Mendocino and Sonoma counties which are bursting with aromatic red fruit scents and complex black fruit flavors. A touch of Petite Sirah and Syrah enhance those flavors even more with bold black and white pepper spices. The batch is then rounded out with a layer of smokiness derived from the new bourbon barrel aging.","6":"Batch 55 embodies an opulent vintage, which saw its fruit grow amid lush rainfall and balmy temperatures. Nuanced aromas of sun-baked raspberry, crushed blueberry, freshly-turned earth and hints of nutmeg swirl in the glass, segueing to a palate of jammy blackberries, clove and caramel. This blend showcases Zinfandel\u2019s warm, luscious character, accentuated by time spent in our charred bourbon barrels, which lent a graceful, smoky finish to the wine.","31":"Gnarly Head 1924 Double Black delivers rich aromas of blackberry preserves, cocoa, raspberry and caramel, setting the stage for a juicy core of concentrated, dense blackberry and fig jam flavors that finish with a hint of baking spice. Jet black in the glass, pair this full-bodied wine with equally bold dishes such as charbroiled bacon cheeseburgers, spicy sausage gumbo or pork baby back ribs slathered in BBQ sauce.","47":"Our 2014 release of KILLER DROP brings together fruit from renowned regions of Northern California including Napa Valley, Sonoma, the Sierra Foothills, Lodi, and Mendocino. Each region contributes distinctive characteristics into the final blend, resulting in an expressive wine with multiple layers of complexity and balance. ","50":"This red blend begins with loads of ripe, dark fruit aromas that are laced with chocolate and vanilla overtones. The wine tastes smooth, soft and sweet and is filled with tons of jammy, ripe fruit. Those chocolate and vanilla streaks from the nose also continue when tasting and add to the mass appeal and crowd-pleasing properties of the wine. On the finish the tart, jammy, sweet fruit lingers for a good amount of time. This is a great choice for fans of the ever popular mass-market slightly-sweet (and often covered by lots of oak influence) red blend.","379":"Version Rose offers aromas of fresh strawberries, Mandarin oranges, and rose petal pastille. Flavors of wild strawberry puree with a dash of rosewater. ","479":"Flavors of Spice, Ginger, Red Rose, Honeycomb and White Pepper.","812":"In the glass there are aromas of dark fruits, plum, spice and toasty oak.

The 2010 is a restrained vintage and will reward those with the patience to cellar a few bottles","1370":"Amberhill Cabernet Sauvignon is a nicely balanced, blended red wine using grapes from several regions of California. After fermentation, the wine is placed into oak barrels for up to one year of oak aging. Smooth and flavorful, it is a consistent award winner and a favorite with the wine media and public. The robust flavors pair nicely with grilled meats, sausages, pizza, tomato based pastas, and aged cheeses.  Spicy, woody aromas lead into flavorful berry and plum character in this medium-bodied Cabernet. The fruit flavors and toasty oak aromas blend perfectly in the smooth, soft finish.","1376":"This intense wine surprises.  It smells sweet, with aromas of honeysuckle, orange blossom and apricot, but it's bone dry.  The citrus and apricot flavors are accompanied by very high acidity.","1629":"This rich red is a blend of 60% Grenache, 25% Syrah and 15% Mourvedre.  It was given a more serious winemaking regimen with a bit more new oak. I also chose a \"bigger\" Syrah to blend in with the Grenache and Mourvedre, so the resulting wine is a bit more \"profound\". I think that it is perhaps the best Esp\u00e9rance that we have ever released. All of the extra work yields a rich, concentrated wine with aromas and flavors of ultra-ripe strawberries, black cherries, and blueberries, mixed in with the spiciness of cinnamon and vanilla from the toasty new French Oak.    ","1704":"This wine is no exception to Angeline's dedication in over-delivering quality in every bottle of wine. The California Pinot Noir is a wealth of aromas such as fresh cranberries, maraschino cherries, and orange zest. The palate is round and juicy with lively acidity, and a touch of sweet, toasty oak on the finish.","1707":"This dense, sophisticated Pinot Noir boastfully over-delivers aromas of fresh strawberries, wild raspberries, and spicy cherry cola. The smooth, resolved palate has a clean, well-balanced acidity that ties up neatly with an understated creamy, caramel finish.","1710":"This mouthwatering Ros\u00e9 will be certain to exceed expectations. With delicious aromas of watermelon, nectarine, and ruby red grapefruit, complemented by floral notes of lilies and orange blossoms, we challenge you not to be delighted. A fruity, sweet front palate of candied strawberries, leads into a crisp, citrus mid, and closes beautifully with a clean, concise acidity on the end. This is destined to be a versatile crowd pleaser.","1779":"The 2014 Annabella Napa Valley Merlot entices from the start with aromas of red plum, ripe cherries, and juicy red nectarine, with a subtle touch of vanilla and milk chocolate. In the mouth, the wine shows milk chocolate, dried cranberries, and a hint of toasted marshmallow. The wine is robust but well balanced and with a lovely texture and creamy tannins, and the lengthy, elegant floral finish.","2217":"Our Arboleda Syrah reflects the small crop of the 1999 vintage with intense violet color, deep spicy flavors and velvety texture. Chosen from the finest grapes grown on our La Arboleda Estate in the Colchagua Valley, and handcrafted on site at our state-of-the-art winery, this Syrah explodes with raspberry, cherry, sweet spices and white chocolate. On the palate, supple mature tannins provide an exquisite texture, confirming the perfect balance between toasty oak and rich ripe fruit characters. A year of barrel aging matured flavors and wove toasty nuances through the lingering finish.","2218":"Our 2000 Arboleda Syrah features intense violet color and spicy red fruit flavor. Layers of raspberry, cherry, spice and chocolate, characteristic of Chilean Syrah, are balanced by mature tannins for an exquisite velvety texture.

This wine is a blend of two different vineyards from the Columbia Valley.  The Bacchus vineyard is on a sandy soil and yields very aromatic fruit while the Sundance vineyard yields aromas and flavors that are spicy with peppery overtones. These grapes from both vineyards were hand-picked and hand-sorted with yields kept low, to produce a wine with concentrated black cherry and blueberry nuances.  The combination of these two vineyards produces a complex and enticing blend. Balanced by a fine acidity and tannin structure, the toasty spices from new French oak add hints of nutmeg, clove and licorice.  We are proud to present our first Syrah to you!","2760":"Personally selected for Artezin, this fruit comes from some of California's finest Zinfandel regions including Sonoma's Dry Creek Valley, Amador (Shenandoah Valley), and Mendocino (Ukiah Valley).","2761":"Ruby red and purple in hue, this wine has aromas of ripe red fruit, with hints of sage, cinnamon and pepper. The fruit flavors flesh out on the palate, dominated by raspberry, boysenberry and red cherry, complemented by hints of nutmeg, rosemary and spice, for a classic varietal character. Soft, supple tannins create a firm, yet lush mouthfeel. With its bright fruit-forward flavor profile, this wine is created for immediate enjoyment.","2895":"Isabelle is comprised of the best cuvees each year from all the wines Au Bon Climat produces and that represents at least 6 different vineyards. The 2012 is a darker, luscious, fruitier Isabelle. It has an intensely perfumed, black raspberry nose with sexy floral and mineral qualities that gain power with air. This one needed no bottle time to show well. Isabelle has proven to age very well, and we routinely drink bottles with 15 years of age. Even though Isabelle is Au Bon Climat's \"biggest\" Pinot Noir with loads of intensity and power, it is still balanced and food friendly.","2896":"Isabelle is comprised of only the best cuvees each vintage. Consequently, it is consistently a top performing Pinot Noir year to year. Dark, rich, and layered, this regal wine is remarkable now, but will be even more integrated and complex in time. ","2897":"Isabelle is unlike any other Au Bon Climat Pinot Noir. Our top Pinot Noirs prior to making Isabelle in 1994 were all single vineyard wines. Isabelle was the first top end Pinot Noir that was a blend from different locations. After the birth of his daughter in 1995, Jim Clendenen wanted to make a special wine in her honor. Isabelle has developed into a unique young woman and her wine is unique for Au Bon Climat, a blended, high-end Pinot Noir. ","2898":"Part of our elite \"Blue Series\", Isabelle is comprised of only the best cuvees each vintage. Consequently, it is consistently our top performing Pinot Noir year to year. The 2016 is particularly dark, rich, and complex.","2924":"This wine is just easy to drink. Whether with fresh grilled salmon or left-over roast chicken or just in a glass by itself, the pretty plum and spring strawberry flavors of ABC SB Pinot are simply delicious. There is nothing pretentious here, just well balanced, nicely textured, brightly fruity wine that seems to go with everything.","2926":"This wine has a firmness and a lean, dry structure that creates the impression of clean and cleansing. A hint of rose petals and light tannins.","3059":"This Merlot is bursting with aromas of deep red fruit that fill the nose. Silky on the palate and full of layers of black cherry, plum, and blueberry flavors delicately intermingled with notes of mocha, vanilla, and spice that lead to a long smooth finish. Bottled to perfection, this is Mother Nature at her finest.","3060":"This Pinot Grigio is zesty and bright, with stone fruit aromas. A crisp, medium-bodied mouthfeel is rounded out with flavors of honeysuckle and lime that envelop the palate.","3061":"This Ros\u00e9 is bright with a nose of wild roses. The palate showcases a fresh, crisp, dry style, boasting with flavors of apricot, honeysuckle, and balanced acidity. A silky, medium-bodied mouthfeel is rounded out with a delicately dry finish.","3063":"The 2010 vintage of the California Cabernet shows aromas of plums, cranberries, allspice and dried ginger with barrel notes of cedar cigar box. The blend of 88% Cabernet, 9% Merlot and a splash of Sangiovese and Zinfandel truly is reflective of its flavors. The dark, jammy core drinks of boysenberry pie, black cherry preserves and currants. Medium in weight, the wine shows silky tannins and just a touch of barrel spice.","3064":"The Avalon California Cabernet shows bright vibrant aromas of blueberry jam, strawberry tart, and boysenberries with hints of vanilla and toasted oak. A dash of Zinfandel give this wine a hint of spice that is followed by rich black cherries, red raspberries, and juicy ripe plums on the long smooth finish.","3065":"Juicy aromas of dark fruit, mocha and spice meet with hints of vanilla. On the palate, black cherry, red raspberry and plum are followed by a long, smooth finish.  Blend: 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Zinfandel, 8% Syrah, 4% Merlot. ","3152":"The 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon experienced an extended hang time and precise watering schedule to maintain proper grape ripeness. The clusters were loose with small berries while the fruit was well-developed and full of varietal flavors during harvest. The summer was mild with the warm days and cool nights typically associated with Santa Barbara County. The fruit developed slowly and ripened fully. Although the Cabernet Sauvignon harvest lasted three full weeks, 90 percent of the fruit came in during the last week of September. This indicated uniformity of ripeness throughout the entire vineyard. ","3253":"This aromatic wine is much more complex than a straight forward Cabernet. The bold, fresh cherry and red fruit flavors incorporate vanilla and oak spice. The bouquet is equally full and expressive. A luscious, balanced wine with great acidity. Beautiful color and rich texture.","3254":"The deep concentration of red currant in the nose and aftertaste can only be achieved by the best Cabernet. A complex and elegant wine full of rich, ripe fruit with a long and intense finish. The integration of acids and linear tannins signified a wine that will age well.","3255":"This is a full, deep and provocative wine. It has rich, dark color with aromas of ripe blackberry, a hint of chocolate and the vanilla of new oak the palate is very well balanced and highlighted by an engaging mouth-filling yet supple texture. Although it retains the alluring nose, color and youthful drinkability of prior vintages, this is a wine for the cellar.","3256":"This classic vintage, with its extended summer, produced a wine with longevity and worthy of many years of cellar aging. It boasts black fruit flavors, intermixed with a cavalcade of subtle nutty and vanilla oak flavors. The pure Cabernet married perfectly with the more acidic and strawberry Sangiovese and is buttressed by the dark Petit Sirah. This is a beautifully balanced and exotic blend.","3257":"The 98' vintage was significantly lower in yield than normal. Spring was cool and hang-time long, producing small, well-spaced berry clusters' with concentrated flavors. This was an outstanding vintage! The aroma is definably Bacio Divino... rich Cabernet aromas abound but with added complexity from the berry\/cherry nose brought forward by the Sangiovese. This vintage has a rich and warm texture. Overall, the wine is mature enough for immediate appeal but with sufficient structure to ensure a long life.","3259":"An Artful Cabernet Sauvignon Blend incorporating 'wee bits' of, Sangiovese, Syrah and Merlot\u2026Bacio Divino shows a bright dark ruby color when poured, releasing aromas of blackberryand current (cassis) fruit, with nuances of sweet vanilla. The palate is rich, yet elegant, andmildly fruit-forward. Yet tannins, acid, oak and fruit are finely balanced in this wine. BacioDivino is as individual as its name \u2013 'divine kiss'. We believe you will enjoy this vintage overthe next decade or two.","3352":"This full-bodied Syrah is a wine of tremendous concentration from the Paso Robles appellation. Four different vineyards make up this wine with each site bringing its own unique characteristics to the final blend. The end result is a deeply purple-hued wine with complex, textured flavors of plum, blueberry, and spice. ","3526":"The 2015 Mordecai has an enticing nose of pepper, violets, cigar and cassis. On the palate it is a mouthwatering m\u00e9lange of red berry and plum flavors backed by earthy tones of herb roasted meat and fresh black trumpet giving way to a spice-laden finish.","3640":"This elegant Pinot is medium ruby in color, and immediately gratifying in the perfume, spring rain and violet floral aromas that fill the glass. Fresh cherries and white pepper spice as well as gravel minerality and black tea are also prevalent. The mouth feel is fleshy, deceivingly full given the color. Brown sugar and crushed red currant are abundant on the palate, with soft tannin and firm acid rounding out the wine. This beautifully balanced wine will age gracefully over the next 7 years, from 2009 to 2016.","3664":"Approximately 8% of the grapes are from the Russian River appellation, are barrel fermented, allowed to complete malolactic fermentation and held sur lie for 5 months. The balance of the grapes from the Santa Ynez Valley and Santa Barbara County are fermented in temperature controlled stainless steel tanks. Each wine is produced separately and a blend is made prior to bottling.","3667":"Rich and complex, drawing on pear, citrus, hazelnut, and mineral flavors, all framed in a creamy-smooth texture with plenty of toasty oak. ","3668":"The Edna Valley appellation produced very distinctive Syrah grapes that resulted in a wine of both distinction and elegance. Look for aromas of white pepper, violet, raspberry, and spice. Aligned with these characters is a wine with beautiful structure and soft mouth feel. Herzog Syrah Special Reserve is Kosher and may be aged, in proper condition, for three to four years past vintage, but is exquisite now. Savor it with roasts, pasta dishes with meat, or veal piccata. (NOT Mevushal)","3669":"Origin: Santa Maria, California Description: Light, refreshing, with a touch of sweetness. Excellent accompaniment for cocktails. Best Served With: Full-flavored Fish, Salads, Cheeses, Pizza, Meat, Veal & Chicken","3794":"Dark ruby-violet color. Ripe vanilla-blackberry jam aromas with hints of black pepper. Medium-full bodied flavors, with bold peppery-spicy dark chocolate-accents. Moderate yet firm, ripe tannins, balanced with good acidity add structure and youthful vigor. A gutsy wine that is more \"brambly\" than previous versions, this Beauzeaux is no joke, however, and would be great with BBQ, and all kinds of grilled meats. The Zinfandel is more noticeable in this year's wine, as is the black pepper of the Petite Sirah. Drink now - four years.","3795":"Medium ruby-garnet color. Dark cherry and loamy-earth aromas, with a slight hint of herbs. Medium bodied, slightly minty, cherry flavors, with a touch of tannin adding length to the finish. The texture is supple, but the flavors have a youthful earthy character a few months in bottle will refine. Not unlike a light Bourgogne rouge from France.","3796":"A stylishly fresh and yet ripely flavored wine! The aromas hint of chili pepper, herbs, lemon and apple. The palate is clean, fresh and lively, yet not too tart that the wine would not be delicious with a seafood salad. The flavors reveal ripe citrus and apple-skin flavors, with a touch of lemon-grass and other herbs. A very easy-to-drink wine.","3797":"Pale, green-yellow color. Distinctive grapefruit, honeydew and lemon zest aromas are very forward and fresh, with a touch of green apple adding a high note. Medium bodied, with melon-citrus fruit flavors framed by ripe acidity. Zesty, highly aromatic and rich. ","3798":"Dark ruby-violet. BV's first California Syrah is exuberant, fruity and just plain delicious! The aroma reveals ripe, jammy, berry and minty-oak scents with a hint of sour cherry. The lush, supple, mouth-filling flavors show a wealth of black pepper, black olive and cocoa , with a juicy yet layered texture. A hint of tannin provides definition to the rich fruitiness of the wine. This is a wine to drink young, to enjoy with grilled meats or poultry, and with Mediterranean cuisine such as ratatouille, bouillabaise or penne all'amatriciana.","3853":"Dark ruby in color, the 1999 Tapestry's aromas evoke scents of black cherry, herbs, vanilla-oak and some black pepper. Medium-full bodied, the wine's fruit flavors are at the forefront; cherry and blackcurrant, followed by nuances of licorice, dark chocolate and peppercorn. Fleshy yet backed by firm, ripe tannins, the finish shows some torrefaction notes from the oak now, but should evolve gracefully with 4-7 years in the bottle.","3974":"#12","3975":"Bedrock Wine Company takes immense pride in the quality of this wine and wants to reflect how good California\u2019s beloved Zinfandel can be. It is about 88% Zinfandel blended with Petite Sirah, Carignan, Alicante Bouschet, and many different interplanted varieties that maintain poise and add complexity and structure.  This has plenty of juiciness and should be delightful in the nearer term with a good decant; however, as many have discovered this wine will age gracefully and improve with time in bottle.","3978":"The Drummond's Petite Sirah is fashioned after the great, long-lived Petite Sirah's of the 1970's like Ridge and Freemark Abbey. The wine is sourced from Eaglepoint Ranch in Mendocino and the Palisades vineyard in Calistoga.","3983":"The base of wine is composed around the ancient plantings of Mourvedre at Bedrock Vineyard and Pagani Ranch, the rest of the blend is composed of dry-farmed Grenache planted in the 1880\u2019s at Gibson Ranch in McDowell Valley and Carignane from the 1950\u2019s planted on soils that remind the winemaker of Pauillac in Ukiah.","4244":"Beran California Zinfandel 2012 is a true representation of what Zinfandel can offer with the ripeness of the warmer regions and brightness from the cooler regions. Grapes picked at optimum ripeness combined with extended fruit maceration over 30 days at times then laid to rest for 12 months in a combination of American and French oak has created a flavor-packed, easy-drinking Zin with a soft, supple mouthfeel and balanced acidity. Zinfandel is one of the most expressive and distinctive grape varieties and when made well should continue to evolve and improve in the bottle.","4245":"Dark red with a black core and deep purple hues. Sweet cedar, cassis, red berry preserves, mocha, and sweet tobacco. Flavors of dried cranberry, ripe red berries, warm cherry pie and caramel apple are complexed with hints of sweet tobacco and spice. Soft and rich with a fresh acidity and fine-grain tannins on the long finish.","4246":"Vibrant ruby red with a dark core and deep purple hues. Sweet tobacco, blackcurrant, raspberry jam, cocoa powder and cigar box. Flavors of cherry, cranberry, raspberry tart and blackberry compote highlighted by notes of sweet cedar and baking spices.

It wants things its own way-including terrain and temperature during both growing and winemaking-and it responds well only to tender, not tough, handling. But I think it is well worth the effort. When Pinot Noir is good, it is very, very good, complex and subtle at the same time, with layers and layers of flavor to be teased out. I consider this grape varietal doubly rewarding when things work well, as I believe they did in this very special vintage. To me, this wine is mouthfilling and very fruit-forward, with loads of bright berry and plum aromas and flavors, layered with cigar-box cedar, sweet vanilla, a touch of a mint, and an elusive light smokiness. -Ed Sbragia, Winemaster","4480":"To me, the flavor of White Zinfandel is a study in contrasts: mellow yet crisp, fruity yet refreshing. The balance between those poles is what makes this wine so versatile. In our food and wine pairing work here at the winery, weve found that White Zinfandel maintains its juicy, delicious flavor when paired with a wide range of foods, from savory to citrusy to spicy dishes.

I still live in a house surrounded by those same vines, and I think of Zinfandel, with its bold but rounded berry flavors, as the classic California wine. I find this wine extremely versatile with food, but I most love to drink it with the robust Mediterranean-based cuisine I grew up with: pastas with rich tomato-based sauces, savory soups and stews, or simply grilled meats and fish. -Ed Sbragia, Winemaster","4664":"The Impetus is our darkest wine, in flavor, color and texture, and is our best Impetus to date. Tench Cabernet Sauvignon provides us with our base of blackberry, cherry and plum, while our De Crescenzo Cabernet Franc provides intensity and depth. In 2013 the Cabernet Franc fermentation filled the winery with violet and lavender aromatics, but below was a dark, brooding beast. You could smell it when you walked up to do a punch down and would smile from ear to ear with anticipation. Then you would get up on the ladder, look down and get nervous. If you fell in no one would see you, it was such a black pit. Next, you would smell the cigar and a hint of leather that warned you to take it seriously. The combination of the two components, in a blend that is almost identical to the EE, is brasher than its sibling, and while it lacks EE\u2019s refinement, it has considerably more swagger.","4665":"The 2014 Impetus is Cabernet Franc from the DeCrescenzo Estate Vineyard and Cabernet Sauvignon from the Tench Vineyard. This is Bevan Cellars' darkest wine in 2014. The Cabernet Franc core is a black hole, which seems to suck light from the air. Dark roasted coffee, anise and spice mingle with the fruit flavors of the Cabernet Sauvignon to give the wine amazing complexity.","4736":"The 2014 Homestead is comprised of 35% Mourvedre, 27% Grenache, 19% Carignane, 16% Syrah & 3% Cabernet Sauvignon.

It is our overriding goal to produce wines that are true to the great vineyard sites we work with. Homestead delivers on this goal at a supreme value.  ","4825":"We are delighted to release into the world our debut vintage of Scylla. Sourced largely from acres of old vines hidden in plain sight along the backroads of Lodi --a short walk from Bechthold-- two old Carignane vineyards planted circa 1920 comprise the backbone of this wine, supplemented by our traditional sources of centenary Grenache and Mourvedre, bringing the average vine age to 99 years.A","4929":"The Blackstone Chardonnay has an alluring bouquet of vanilla, citrus, and floral aromas. The aromatics lead into a vivacious palate bursting with fresh citrus and tropical fruits, perfectly balanced with exotic coconut and vanilla. A crisp and graceful finish complements the wonderful framework of flavors. At Blackstone we believe our wines should be friendly, flavorful and balanced, encouraging one's interest in the marriage between food and wine.","4930":"Deep garnet color, medium-full bodied and mature flavors recalling dark plum, dusty chocolate and exotic spice couched in firm but rounded tannins.

Full-bodied on the entry, aromas of black plum jam and toasty oak set the stage for what is to come. Vibrant boysenberries and luscious fruit are framed by serious tannins, while wisps of leather and vanilla seduce just enough. A final touch of acidity finishes the wine with a precisely balanced mouthfeel.  ","5998":"Voluptuous and full-bodied on the entry, the heady aromas of black currants and plums awaken the senses. Lusciously jammy and inky in appearance, the concentrated fruit wraps itself around tones of pipe tobacco, leather and cocoa, to mesmerize the palate. Juniper and spice seduce the supple tannins, as this wine finishes long and lingering, but not before a final touch of acidity charms the balanced mouthfeel yet again. ","5999":"Deeply inky, this wine coats the glass and lingers before the first sip has been taken. Heady aromas of boysenberries and blackberries headline the entry, while flavors of wild blueberries steal the show. Full-bodied and concentrated, seductive juniper and anise tangle with coffee and leather tones as the wine's finish lingers on stage. Enduring and enthralling, this wine is perfectly suited for an encore.","6000":"Showcasing the varietal's trademark characteristics, the wine is impressively inky, dark and luscious in the glass. Supple fruits, including wild blackberry and Oregon blueberry, are distinct both in the aromatics and on first sip. Concentrated and rich, savory notes of toasty oak combine with mocha and hints of salted caramel. The finish, firm and full bodied, lingers and lasts as only Petite Sirah can. ","6001":"#11","6002":"Dark purple stains the glass, a perfect showcase for the fruits in this intense red wine. Inky and succulent blueberries and blackberries overwhelm the palate, while a touch of roasted, savory and earthy tones round out the mouthfeel. Supple and spicy, this full bodied wine was aged in American oak for 14 months. Toasty vanilla on the finish combines with chalky and chewy tannins to create a finish with structure and character.","6003":"2016 vintage is no exception.

Juicy plums and rhubarb come together, followed by touches of roasted, savory and earthy tones that round out the mouthfeel.

Toasty vanilla, mocha and a bit of cocoa combine with ample tannins to create a finish with structure and character.","6004":"This ruby red spectre entices with rich blackberry and briary boysenberry. Provocative dark fruits envelop the nose and palate, leaving the essence of flavors brought forth by the grapes during winemaking. Black cherry and anise abound, leading to a sturdy finish of black pepper, pipe tobacco and spicy oak. Aged for over two years in 1 and 2 year old American oak focus and intensify the Zinfandel, Petite Sirah and Mourvedre, creating yet another passionate and commanding red wine, impossible to ignore.

The mouthfeel, silky and refined, brightens with ripe chokeberry and currant, while touches of pipe tobacco and worn leather round out the sip. French and American oak make a lasting impression, leaving this wine with a balanced finish of toasted spices and refined tannins.","6010":"Bogle winemakers have sourced fruit from the best growing regions in California for the varietal. The terroirs of the cool Russian River Valley, coastal Monterey hills and the unique Clarksburg Delta all grow fruit of character and distinction. Combined, the resulting wine is and elegant, classic Pinot Noir.","6011":"Vibrant on the nose with notes of lemon grass, mowed hay and a touch of jalape\u00f1o, this wine awakens the senses before the first sip. Lively, exotic flavors of passion fruit and kiwi are quenching and delightful, with a touch of softness in the mid palate. Mouthwatering gooseberry and lime finish clean and bright, and ready for another sip.","6167":"It is lean, neither overly alcoholic nor overly extracted, nor overly oaked; it is precisely what one would imagine A Proper Claret to be. The wine contains a substantial dollop of Petit Verdot, adding a silky note of violets and textural elegance, in counterpoint to the lead-in-the-pencil firmness offered by the inclusion of the virile Tannat. Tannat, the grape implicated in the French paradox (and the vinifera variety with resveratrol levels that are off the charts), is principally grown in Gascony (land of Les Trois Mousquetaires), though it was historically grown as well in Bordeaux as late as the 19th century.Comparing this wine with the 2012 APC, the inaugural vintage, the '13 version is a bit plusher and posher, with softer tannins, not unreminiscent of the overstuffed chair at one's Club. There is still a lovely minty, cedary aspect to this wine, reflective of its perfect balance, with nary a prunish note to be found. ","6168":"Blend: 40% Merlot, 24% Petit Verdot, 21% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Cabernet Franc, 4% Malbec","6176":"An altogether new wine for us and a terribly exciting one at that. We have taken to heart some of the lessons learned from fooling around with syrah in southern France. Very long cuvaisons with whole clusters, a sort of mac\u00e9ration carbonique manqu\u00e9e, if you will, then micro-bubbleage to a fare-thee-well seems to be a great format for the retention of spice and fragrance in syrah from, shall we say, thermically overachieving climats. The other great lesson is that one can blend various syrahs from different terroirs and climats in much the same way that one blends different c\u00e9pages to attain complexity and balance. The grapes from the way cool Bien Nacido Vineyard seemed to enhance the mentholated quality that we adore to death. Syrah from the very shy-yielding Chequera vineyard in Paso provided an extremely powerful backbone upon which we were able to overlay and layer in the fine lapidary bits. This is a very potent syrah that still possesses a remarkably fine perfume. It is my expectation that the wine will be a tremendous hit amongst admirers of Old World terroir\/funk as well as with brave New World fruit bombardiers.","6177":"\"Made the way Randall Grahm likes Syrah, which is a dry, peppery wine with rich outbursts of sweet cherry fruit. It must be the blending, but this wine seems to possess both warm- and cool-climate aspects, which is often what works best in a Californa Syrah. It's rich but dry, fruity but elegant, a Euro-wine of instant, and international, appeal.\"","6181":"From what far-flung, telic appellation might be dispatched a white cigar?

We are so pleased to be back in the Telegram business again, having just inked a long-term contract with our friends, the Del Barbas of Oakley and environs. This wine made entirely from very old (100+ yr.) mourvedre. \u201898 was an anomalous vintage, the latest that we had ever harvested mourvedre. The extra time on the vine has given the wine an extremely complex, aromatic profile and a modicum of finesse, its outsized physique notwithstanding.","6210":"There is a tender spot in my heart for pink wine. (This is spoken by a man who is very secure with respect to his gender issues.) As a genus, pink wine is seldom taken seriously and yet vin en rose is capable of offering among the most blissful moments that a mere alcoholic beverage can provide. Producing a great pink wine is generally a thankless task, it must be said. When it works, people are pleased but generally remain mute. When it is less than brilliant, punters rosaphobic prejudices are simply confirmed. Somewhere in the process of making pink wine, you are faced with the forking path of maximizing fruitiness and the optimization of complexity. When in doubt, go for everything, perhaps best typifies our attitude here at Bonny Doon. The wine was left on its lees, which were periodically stirred; this has added complexity and a wonderful creaminess of texture. At the same time, the wine has retained its fructive supremacy - wild strawberry and shockingly vivid guava are the dominant tones, complemented by more discreet suggestions of peach and (what else) pink grapefruit. Our pink is a highly nuanced proprietary blend and strongly Syrah dominant - I can tell you that much under the Freedom of Vinformation Act - and as such, it is quite spicy, pleasingly peppery and saturated with the sap of spring. Varietal Composition: Syrah, Mourvedre, Grenache, Cinsault, Pinot Meunier, Charbono, Dolcetto","6211":"When we last spoke, spice and perfume merchants were haggling over lavender oil, rose petals and sandalwood while sipping  dry ros\u00e9 at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 in Grasse, deep in the heart of Provence. And why would they not sip ros\u00e9, a potation which  so strongly evokes the invigorating fragrance of wild aromatic herbs and botanicals common to the south of France?  The 2004 Vin Gris is not the pudgy, alcoholic endomorph one might expect from such a hot, early year. In fact, the acid is a bit more  pronounced compared to the previous vintage, perhaps because the wine is once again bone dry, unlike the ever so confected 2003. This  2004 is indeed one of the more classically styled editions of Vin Gris to date. All the signifiers we have come to associate with classic  Proven\u00e7al style ros\u00e9 are there\u2014a definite suggestion of aromatic herbs, citrus rind, rosehips and hibiscus along with a very pleasing,  mild astringency on the back palate. This makes for a delicious ap\u00e9ritif, and allows the wine to pair much more elegantly with a wide  variety of foods. Here one might imagine poached salmon, assorted birds or, if one fancies oneself a true Proven\u00e7al, a bowl of  bouillabaisse or a generous portion of ratatouille.","6212":"We continue down the primrose path of insinuating a substantial dollop of white wine\u2014principally grenache blanc\u2014into our typical blend of red varieties. Though not a technique practiced widely in Vin Gris' spiritual homeland of Provence, we find the addition of rich white wine adds some incremental gravity and seriousness without jeopardizing the final blend's personal and electrochemical vivacity\u2014a quality critical in the perfect aperitif, or if one wishes to wash down a Salade Ni\u00e7oise under the hot sun of St. Tropez. 2005 was much cooler than its predecessor and we find brighter, filigreed fruit notes here\u2014watermelon, cranberry and strawberry guava. The botanical, Proven\u00e7al herb notes so infused in last year's model merely float on top of this wine as if carried aloft by a gentle offshore breeze.

Hints of wild strawberry, white cherry, apple blossom, and the barest whiff of spearmint. Palate is quite dry and zesty with pale red fruits, blood orange, citrus, and a lean yet supple finish. But what is most compelling about the wine is its elegance. We deployed far less skin contact than in years past, and in this instance, less is truly more. Delicious today but will develop added richness and aroma with an additional 6-12 months of bottle age.","6214":"Fresh and bright with a shell pink color reminiscent of a C\u00f4tes de Provence Ros\u00e9.

It started early, stayed late, and along the way brought upside down weather patterns that found days warm when they should be cool, and cool when they should be warm. Bud break for Chardonnay began to creep out in the warmest hillsides in February following an exceptionally mild winter. We had rain and cold in April, warm May days, showers in June and thunderstorms in July. Go figure. While we worried about rain during harvest, we found instead a beautiful Indian Summer that let grapes hang and develop full flavors, with higher acids that lead to this vintage having a bright, crisp showing that should be very pleasing. Flavors were even more concentrated as most vineyards found yields for Chardonnay 20-30% below average, allowing vines to concentrate energy in the fruit. Judicious shoot thinning and the careful eye that comes with organic farming led, in the end, to one of the most memorable vintages of the new century so far.
